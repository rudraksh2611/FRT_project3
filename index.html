        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">For 30 years, Microsoft Research (MSR) has been at the forefront of advancing the foundations of computing and translating new scientific understanding into innovative technologies to create value for Microsoft customers and broad benefit to society. 
            MSR has been a pioneer, delivering cutting-edge AI breakthroughs in vision, speech, language, decision making and machine learning, including conversational speech recognition, machine translation, image captioning, and common-sense question answering, and we translate 
            these breakthroughs into products to help Microsoft customers. We’re not inventing for the sake of inventing, we are focused on how the AI systems of today can help people solve real-world challenges.
            “The age of AI is upon us, and Microsoft is powering it. We are witnessing nonlinear improvements in the capability of foundation models, which we are making available as platforms.” – Satya Nadella</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Collaborative filtering is the de facto standard for analyzing users’ activities and building recommendation systems for items.
              In this work we develop Sliced Anti-symmetric Decomposition (SAD), a new model for collaborative filtering based on implicit feedback. In contrast to traditional techniques where a latent representation of users (user vectors) and items (item vectors) are estimated,
              SAD introduces one additional latent vector to each item, using a novel three-way tensor view of user-item interactions.</p>
